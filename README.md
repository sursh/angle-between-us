# The angle between us

We're all walking around on Earth. Which is a planet. A planet that is not flat. 

When we're in the same place, our bodies are roughly parallel. But as we go farther and farther apart we start pointing in different directions. And when we go all the way around the globe, people are pointing the other way! 

This is a little project to compute the angles between people at different points on earth, to bring us in touch with the geometry of our home planet. 

Someday it'll show you a picture of what these angles look like on a website. 

# Example Outputs

The angle between Los Angeles and Chicago is 25 degrees

The angle between Los Angeles and London is 78 degrees

The angle between Los Angeles and Mumbai is 125 degrees

# TODO

- [x] Find lat/lon info for major cities
- [x] Compute angle between two cities on the globe
- [ ] Deploy to a hosted website 
- [ ] Allow user selection of cities from the list
- [ ] Find someone who knows how to do visual website things to help with next step
- [ ] Display results visually (with people at different angles) rather than just the angle in degrees
- [ ] (maybe) Allow arbitrary geographical inputs
